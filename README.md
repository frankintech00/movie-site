This app is a movie search app built using the React JavaScript library. It utilizes the useReducer and useEffect hooks from React, as well as several custom components (Header, Movie, Search). The app makes API calls to the Open Movie Database (OMDB) to search for movies based on user input.

The app has an initial state with properties for movies, errorMessage, and loading. The useReducer hook is used to manage the app's state and handle different actions (SEARCH_MOVIES_REQUEST, SEARCH_MOVIES_SUCCESS, SEARCH_MOVIES_FAILURE) that change the state based on the outcome of the API call. The useEffect hook is used to fetch movies initially when the app loads.

The search function is used to handle user input and make API calls to search for movies based on the input. If the API call is successful, the SEARCH_MOVIES_SUCCESS action is dispatched and the movies property in the state is updated with the search results. If the API call is not successful, the SEARCH_MOVIES_FAILURE action is dispatched and the errorMessage property in the state is updated with the error message.

The app's UI displays a header, a search bar, and a grid of movie cards. The grid displays loading or error messages when appropriate and displays the movie cards when the search is successful.
